## Original Demos
These are the original demos from the `examples` folder in this repo, modified to be run in `Google Colabortory`. 

[colab_tutorial_credit_scoring.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/josephineHonore/AIF360/blob/master/colab_examples/colab_tutorial_credit_scoring.ipynb):
Getting started with AIF360

[demo_adversarial_debiasing.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/josephineHonore/AIF360/blob/master/colab_examples/demo_adversarial_debiasing.ipynb): demonstrates the use of the adversarial debiasing in-processing algorithm to learn a fair classifier

[tutorial_medical_expenditure.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/josephineHonore/AIF360/blob/master/colab_examples/tutorial_medical_expenditure.ipynb): is a comprehensive tutorial demonstrating the interactive exploratory nature of a data scientist detecting and mitigating racial bias in a care management scenario.


## Workshop notebooks
These notebooks are for the fairness workshop. They are based on the original notebooks with small modifications for the workshop.
