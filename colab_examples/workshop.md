# Fairness workshop

During this workshop you will get hands-on knowledge on how to work with `AIF360`.

We will work with the following notebooks, that you will run directly in your browser by using Google Colab. They are ordered in increasing difficulty. Be patient, read all text and run the notebooks. At the end of each notebook, there are some questions and excercises to verify your understanding.

1. [colab_workshop_tutorial_credit_scoring.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/josephineHonore/AIF360/blob/master/colab_examples/colab_workshop_tutorial_credit_scoring.ipynb):
Getting started with AIF360

2. [colab_workshop_adversarial_debiasing.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/josephineHonore/AIF360/blob/master/colab_examples/colab_workshop_adversarial_debiasing.ipynb): demostrates the use of adversarial in-processing algorithm to learn a fair classifier. It contains further excercises to follow up.

3. [colab_workshop_tutorial_medical_expenditure.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/josephineHonore/AIF360/blob/master/colab_examples/colab_workshop_tutorial_medical_expenditure.ipynb): is a comprehensive tutorial demonstrating the interactive exploratory nature of a data scientist detecting and mitigating racial bias in a care management scenario. This notebook has some modifications with respect to the [original](https://colab.research.google.com/github/josephineHonore/AIF360/blob/master/colab_examples/tutorial_medical_expenditure.ipynb)
